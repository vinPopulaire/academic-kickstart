abstract = "Recent market research has revealed a globally growing interest on documentaries that have now become one of the most populated content-wise genre in the movie titles catalog, surpassing traditionally popular genres such as comedy or adventure films. At the same time, modern audiences appear willing to immerse into more interactive and personalized viewing experiences. Documentaries, even in their linear version, involve high costs in all phases (pre-production, production, post-production) due to various inefficiencies, partly attributed to the lack of scientifically-proven cost- effective Information and Communications Technology (ICT) tools. To fill this gap, a set of innovative ICT tools is delivered that focus on supporting all stages of the documentary creation process, ranging from the documentary topic selection to its final delivery to the viewers. This paper provides an overview of the respective tools, elaborating on two specific tools that primarily focus on the interests and satisfaction of the targeted audience: the Integrated Trends Discovery tool and the Social Recommendation & Personalization tool, elaborating on their design, functionality and performance, and concludes with exposing the future plans and potential regarding these tools."
